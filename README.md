This group project is part of the course Special Topics in Energy Power Systems (9th Semester - ECE AuTH). Main subject of the project is the study and design of the electrical installation for a textile plant. <br>
As a team we: <br>
-Analyzed and assessed the electrical distribution system of the textile plant, including transformers, switchgear and load flow <br>
-Conducted a comprehensive study of the grounding system to ensure personnel safety and equipment protection <br>
-Evaluated cable sizing, selection and routing to optimize power delivery and minimize voltage drop <br>
-Designed the substation area and selected the appropriate equipment, including protection relays and circuit breakers <br>
